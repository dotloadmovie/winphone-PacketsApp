Windows Phone prototype application. Implements a bi-directional WinJS/BackboneJS bridge (ie Windows views can extend Backbone Views or vice-versa)

When up and running, acts as an audio walking guide. Mashes a location geofence with localized Wikipedia results and runs them through the WinPhone text-to-speech generator.
